# Chapter 7: OpenAIService

In the [previous chapter (VoiceChatActor)](06_voicechatactor_.md), we saw how an actor can handle AI chat and text-to-speech requests in real time. Now let’s shine the spotlight on the behind-the-scenes prompter that actually talks to OpenAI’s API, generating creative text responses and realistic speech. That prompter is our **OpenAIService**.

## Why Do We Need OpenAIService?

Picture a theater production where:
1. Actors need lines from a master scriptwriter on-the-fly.  
2. The script has to be performed in a natural spoken voice.  
3. We want a quick, centralized place to ask for these lines without re-inventing the wheel.  

OpenAIService acts as that master scriptwriter. It:
- Retrieves AI-generated text (like ChatGPT responses).  
- Converts text into lifelike voice recordings.  
- Centralizes all AI interactions so our actors (like the [VoiceChatActor](06_voicechatactor_.md)) don’t have to worry about external API details.

## Use Case: Chat + Voice

If you want a conversation with an AI “cast member” that speaks, you’ll:
1. Send your input text to the [VoiceChatActor](06_voicechatactor_.md).  
2. The actor calls OpenAIService to ask for a witty or informative reply.  
3. It also asks OpenAIService to generate TTS (text-to-speech) audio for that reply.  
4. The user hears the AI’s spoken response and sees the text on screen.

By keeping OpenAI’s complexities in one class (OpenAIService), the rest of your app can speak and chat with minimal fuss.

## Key Concepts of OpenAIService

1. **Chat Completions**  
   - Takes your user’s prompt and a conversation history.  
   - Returns an AI-generated answer, courtesy of OpenAI.

2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**  
   - Feeds your text into an AI-based TTS model.  
   - Returns raw audio data that can be played back in the browser.

3. **Centralized API Handling**  
   - Safely stores your OpenAI API key.  
   - Handles potential errors or network issues so your main app logic stays simple.

## How to Use OpenAIService

To keep things extra friendly, let’s walk through a minimal scenario: fetching a chat response, then generating some speech for it. (In practice, the [VoiceChatActor](06_voicechatactor_.md) does these steps on behalf of your app.)

### 1) Getting a Chat Completion (Short Example)

Below is a small snippet of code (under 10 lines) that shows how you might call the service to get an AI response:

```csharp
var openAiService = new OpenAIService();
var conversation = new List<string> { "AI: Hello, how can I assist you today?" };
string userInput = "Can you tell me a joke?";

var aiReply = await openAiService.GetChatCompletion(userInput, conversation);
// aiReply might be something like: "Sure! Here's a joke..."
Console.WriteLine(aiReply);
```

Explanation:  
- We create an instance of `OpenAIService`.  
- We pass in a small conversation history, plus the user’s new input.  
- `GetChatCompletion(...)` contacts OpenAI for a response.  
- We print the AI’s reply to the console.

### 2) Converting Text to Voice

Once you have AI-generated text, you can ask the service to convert it into an audio track:

```csharp
string textToSpeak = "Hello there, I'm an AI voice.";
float[] voiceData = await openAiService.ConvertTextToVoiceAsync(textToSpeak, "alloy");

// voiceData is a float array of PCM samples to be played in your application
```

Explanation:  
- `ConvertTextToVoiceAsync(...)` calls a TTS model.  
- The final result is a float array of raw audio samples (`voiceData`).  
- Play these samples in your Blazor application (e.g., using JavaScript or the [VoiceChatActor](06_voicechatactor_.md)).

## Under the Hood: Sequence Overview

Here’s a simple flow of how OpenAIService handles these requests:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Actor as VoiceChatActor
    participant OAS as OpenAIService
    participant OAI as OpenAI API
    Actor->>OAS: GetChatCompletion("Tell me a joke")
    OAS->>OAI: Sends user prompt + conversation
    OAI->>OAS: Returns AI-generated text
    Actor->>OAS: ConvertTextToVoiceAsync("AI text reply")
    OAS->>OAI: Sends text to TTS model
    OAI->>OAS: Returns audio data
```

1. The [VoiceChatActor](06_voicechatactor_.md) sends the user text to **OpenAIService** for a chat reply.  
2. **OpenAIService** calls the actual OpenAI API.  
3. The OpenAI API returns the text.  
4. The actor then requests TTS from **OpenAIService**.  
5. **OpenAIService** again contacts OpenAI to get audio.  
6. The actor receives the audio data and can play it.

---

## Internal Implementation

In “OpenAIService.cs,” you’ll see something like this (simplified):

```csharp
public class OpenAIService
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    public OpenAIService()
    {
        string apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("OPENAI_API_KEY");
        _httpClient = new HttpClient();
        _httpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://api.openai.com/v1/");
        _httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization 
            = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", apiKey);
    }

    public async Task<string> GetChatCompletion(string message, List<string> history)
    {
        // 1) Combine user message + chat history
        // 2) Send to OpenAI endpoint
        // 3) Return the AI's text reply
        return "FakeResponse"; // For brevity here
    }

    public async Task<float[]> ConvertTextToVoiceAsync(string text, string voice)
    {
        // 1) Call TTS endpoint with text + voice
        // 2) Receive MP3 (or other format)
        // 3) Convert to float[] for playback
        return new float[0]; // Simplified
    }
}
```

Explanation:  
1. A `HttpClient` is set up with the base URL and your “Bearer” token for OpenAI.  
2. `GetChatCompletion` packages user input and history, sends it to OpenAI’s chat endpoint, and returns the response.  
3. `ConvertTextToVoiceAsync` calls a TTS endpoint, then decodes the resulting audio into raw float samples.

**Note**: In the real code, you’ll see more details (like error checking, JSON serialization, or MP3 conversion).

## Conclusion

Our **OpenAIService** is the “backstage teleprompter” that:
1. Crafts AI-based replies (Chat Completion).  
2. Transforms text to audio (Text-to-Speech).  
3. Keeps your app’s main logic free from API details.  

Combined with the [VoiceChatActor](06_voicechatactor_.md), you can orchestrate a lively AI co-host that not only chats but speaks convincingly. This concludes the grand tour of how BlazorVoice handles everything from capturing audio in the browser to generating AI-driven speech. Now, you’re ready to adapt, extend, and bring new features to your AI voice chat show!

Thanks for following along! If you’d like to keep exploring, try experimenting with custom voice styles or additional conversation features. Happy coding!
